# Social Cues and Intrinsic Curiousity
## Description
We are investigating how social cues may affect a participant’s curiosity toward a blurred image. In our study, participants will be presented with two images–both will be blurred and assigned a number of “upvotes”.  The degree of blurriness will differ between the two images, and the number of upvotes will be sourced from Reddit. Images with more upvotes will signal that more people found that image interesting. Participants will be asked to choose one image to reveal, and we will interpret this choice as the participant being more curious about that image. Lastly, the image will be revealed and a new trial will begin. We expect the number of upvotes on an image to have a varying amount of influence on participant curiosity, depending on the degree to which the image is blurred.
